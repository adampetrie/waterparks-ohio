From thrill-seekers to kids, you will find fun at Wildwater Kingdom for the entire family! Thunder Falls is Ohio's tallest waterslide - after climbing the 100 foot tower you can choose to ride one of three enclosed body slides or four inner tube slides.  Wildwater Kingdom also features Liquid Lighting - a four person raft that plunges 60 feet down an enormous funnel, a 390,000 gallon wave pool and a 1,100 foot long lazy river.  The kids will love Splash Landing - a four story structure with water slides, soaking gadgets, geysers, water cannons and a giant bucket that tips over 1,000 gallons of water.
