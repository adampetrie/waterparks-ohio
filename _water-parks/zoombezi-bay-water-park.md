Located in central Ohio, Zoombezi Bay is a 22 acre water park offering fun and excitement for the whole family.  With over 17 water slides, a wave pool, an action river, an adults-only lazy river, private cabanas, and childrenâ€™s interactive play structure with 100 water features, there is something for everyone!  Highlights include Python Plunge, a water coaster that will take you uphill in the first 10 seconds and then shoot into a 70-foot long landing pool, and Sound Surfer, a 512-foot, five-person raft ride with themed LED lights, speakers and music.  

Also, admission to the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, with over 7,000 animals, is included in your ticket price.
